1.  Write a program to calculate the average marks of Mathematics=95, Biology=80, Chemistry=75, Physics=70, and English=90 of a student.

2.  You are given three numbers 13, 79, and 45. Write a program that will print the largest 
    number using if-else.

3.  You are given a triangle with the sides 9, 8, 9. Write a program to check whether a triangle 
    is Isosceles or not using if-else. (Isosceles => two sides are equal.)

4.  You got your final exam result. Your total score is 85. The grading chart is in the below:

    80 or above A grade
    60 or above B grade
    50 or above C grade
    40 or above D grade
    39 or less  F grade

    Write a program to find your grade using if-else.

5.  You are in a hurry to go to your school on time. But when you are crossing the road, the 
    traffic signal is red coloured. In this situation, if you try to cross the road, you may be in danger.If you notice a yellow coloured traffic signal, you should stop. If you notice a green coloured traffic signal, you should cross the road. So write a JS code, where there is a variable called signal. Its value can be green, yellow or red & we will get different activities as output depending on the variable. So, hurry up.
